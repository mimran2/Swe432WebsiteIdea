SWE432 - Statement of Contributions

For this homework assignment, Mahnoor was responsible for implementing the calendar and adding events as a time managing tool for students, while I took care of Firebase and storing data from Registration.

We ran into some problems as neither of us know much about any of this, but Mahnoor was able to get the calendar working. I originally used push() to push an array to the server, but that creates some redundancies so I decided to strip out the username and use it as a node for every user (which would make searching for them easier later on).
