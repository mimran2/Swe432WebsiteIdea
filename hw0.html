Project Ideas:
We have a few ideas for our project. Not sure if any of them are able to fulfill all the requirements so we will list them all and go from 
whatever gets approve. One idea is to make a website that is like an open iClicker for students and teachers to use that is free. Tophat 
exists but is not free. We would like to make something that can also be tied with an app. The website will have to be dynamic in order to 
allow teachers to take attendance/surveys/post assignments and take quizzes online when someone signs up with an account. Not exactly sure 
how to incorporate a web service into that. We're looking for some input for that part. Maybe we could incorporate gmail into it and have 
everyone sign in via their gmail account. That might give us a way to incorporate some google api. It will incorporate visuals because you 
can see averages of other classes and the quiz scores/attendance rates/grades etc. And it will definitely have the logic there where 
students can check their scores/post questions and get feedback on assignments. In other words it would be a piazza/tophat mesh. Teachers
would be able to post note, students would be able to ask/answer questions and it could be used for attendance and quizzes/surveys/iclicker
questions. We think this fulfills all the requirements.
Other ideas we have include making a website that matches up students with students 
who have taken the same classes already so that they can exchange/purchase/rent books from one another. This might require some kind of 
paypal/credit card interaction which we arent exactly sure of existing. There probably is but we need help finding a webservice to include 
with this. As for visuals we can display stats about the discount students are getting off of the retail/amazon/ebay prices which would help
with the inclusion of some kind of api. The logic portion would be interacting with other websites to see their rates as well as displaying
and calculating the sales that have been generated through the website.
Another idea we have is making a website that allows people to look up events near them via zipcode which we could integrate google maps into
as well as maybe some events websites. The logic portion we're not sure about it'll probably be more like providing info between a third party
website and our website to the client. For visuals we could provide images of what the event is or how pie charts to events showing how 
sold out they are and how popular the events have been in the past?
